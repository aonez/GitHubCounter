# GitHubCounter

![GitHubCounter Icon](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/blob/master/GitHubCounter.safariextension/icon-128.png)

A Safari extension that displays releases downloads counter.

### How to install:

- On the Mac App Store: [Ghounter](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/ghounter/id1438633677)
- Manually download the [latest release](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases/latest) or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases) page and choose your prefered version. Note external extensions are no more supported on Safari 12+.

### How it works:

It just shows the downloads count near each release in GitHub. No toolbar elements, no bars, nothing else.

An example:

### Using Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave... 

Just use [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads) from [@addshore](https://github.com/addshore), as this one is based on it.

### It uses:

- `contentscript.js` from [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads), many thanks to [@addshore](https://github.com/addshore)'s work. It is all the code this extension runs.

- Icon based on [this one](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1055068/arrow_cloud_down_download_icon#size=512) made by [Nick Roach](http://www.elegantthemes.com).
